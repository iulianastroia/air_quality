# air_quality
This project is done with Flask framework, combining several technologies, such as Python, JavaScript, jQuery È™i MySQL. Its goal is studying data received from certain sensors which measure air quality, such as formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, particulate matter of different dimensions, ozone, volatile organic compound, humidity, pressure and temperature. The workflow follows some steps,such as preparation of data, their analysis, the detection of possible anomalies and obtaining some services, such as timeseries, predictions and heatmaps. Recorded data was taken from a device situated in the center of Brasov. The project aims to test several prediction algorithms, so that their accuracy can be determined. Moreover, their performance is tested by metrics and residual plots. The project combines statistical elements and machine learning. Also, the project calculates the air quality index for the given concentrations recorded by the sensors and displays the results in a representative colored heatmap. Moreover, the application is available in two languages: Romanian and English. The application uses API to obtain the recorded data and also to collect real time information about the air quality index from the whole world. Moreover, the project offers predictions for the next five days for all sensors which present interest.
